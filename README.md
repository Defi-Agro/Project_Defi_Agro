> Tokenizing real-world agricultural production via NFTs. Connecting global DeFi capital to farmers in LATAM.

## 🎯 Vision

DeFi-Agro eliminates 40% intermediary costs in agricultural financing by creating a transparent, blockchain-based ecosystem where:

- 🌍 **Investors** finance production units (1 NFT = 1 demand) and earn 40% of the production profit.
- 🚜 **Farmers** receive inputs upfront with **0% interest** 
- 🏭 **Buyers** access traceable commodities with automated logistics

**Market Opportunity:** $12T global agriculture → <1% tokenized
